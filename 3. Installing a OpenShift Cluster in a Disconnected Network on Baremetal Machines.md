After you define an identity provider and create a new cluster-admin user, you can remove the kubeadmin to improve cluster security.


> **[!WARNING]**
> If you follow this procedure before another user is a cluster-admin, then OpenShift Container Platform must be reinstalled. It is not possible to undo this command.

### Prerequisites

* You must have configured at least one identity provider.
* You must have added the cluster-admin role to a user.
* You must be logged in as an administrator.
